txTitle14=The Case of the Telltale Frog Hearts
&txSubtitle14=A Neuroscience Mystery
&tx14a=The heart of the frog, like the human heart, is controlled by nerves.
&tx14b=A branch of the vagus nerve carries electrical signals that cause the heart to slow down.
&tx14c=How does the vagus nerve communicate with the heart?
&tx14c1=• Does the electrical signal pass directly into the heart muscle?
&tx14c2=• Does the electrical signal cause the nerve to release chemicals that slow the heart?
&tx14d=The answer to this neuroscience mystery is a key to understanding how the nervous system communicates with the body.
&tx14e=You can solve this mystery by doing three simple tests.
&tx18button1=Test 1
&tx18button2=Test 2
&tx18button3=Test 3
&tx19a=A beating frog heart without a vagus nerve will be placed into a salt solution. 
Let's see if the rate of the heart changes while it is immersed in this solution.
&tx19a1=Heart B
&tx19a2=Heart A
&tx19b=The drum recorder lets us monitor heart rate over time. 
Click the beaker to fill it with salt solution, and then watch the red pen tracing to decide whether the heart rate changes.
&tx19bask=How did the salt solution affect the heart rate?
&tx19choice1=The heart beats faster.
&tx19choice2=The heart rate is unchanged.
&tx19choice3=The heart beats slower.
&tx19c=A drum recorder lets us monitor heart rate over time.
&tx19d=The drum recorder indicates a steady heart rate.
&tx25a=Watch closely. The pen tracing on the drum shows that the heart is beating at a steady rate.
&tx25b=If the heart had slowed down, the pulses on the tracing would have appeared farther apart as time passed. 
&tx25b2=If the heart had sped up, the pulses on the tracing would have appeared closer together as time passed.
&tx25c=The pulses stayed evenly spaced, so the salt solution didn't have any noticeable effect on the heart rate.
&tx25a1=I agree. The pulses stayed evenly spaced, so your conclusion that the solution has no effect on the heart rate is probably correct.
&tx28a=If the vagus nerve releases some heart-slowing chemical, some of it may leak into the salt solution.
We'll use Heart A, which has a vagus nerve attached, to test this hypothesis.
&tx28b=Heart B has no vagus nerve. 
If solution taken from around the nerve of Heart A can slow down Heart B, we'll have strong evidence that the nerve produces a heart-slowing chemical.
&tx28b1=Drag the pipet into the solution over Heart A to collect a sample of solution.
&tx28b2=Good. Now empty the pipet over Heart B by dragging it into the solution in the other beaker.
&tx28b3=Watch the red drum tracings carefully for changes in the rate of Heart B.
&tx28c=Does solution taken from Heart A change the rate of Heart B?
&tx28d=Perhaps the nerve only releases the heart-slowing chemical when it is stimulated. 
&tx29a=Heart with vagus nerve still attached
&tx29b=Heart with vagus nerve removed
&tx29c=Electrical stimulation slows down this heart.
&tx29d=Contact with solution from Heart A slows down Heart B.
&tx32a=Now test the solution after an electrical signal has passed through the vagus nerve of Heart A.
Click on the electrodes to stimulate the nerve.
&tx32a1=Watch the blue drum tracing carefully to see how stimulating the nerve affects the rate of Heart A.
&tx32b=Does the solution around the stimulated nerve contain a substance that can slow the heart? 
&tx37a=Yes. Heart B slowed down after exposure to solution collected from Heart A.
&tx37b=Some heart-slowing substance must have been present in the solution you transferred by pipet.
&tx38a=I disagree. The red tracing on the drum shows that Heart B slowed down after being exposed to solution from Heart A.
&tx59=Conclusions
&tx59a=What can we infer about communication in the nervous system?
&tx59b=Signals are electrical only.
&tx59c=Signals are chemical only.
&tx59d=Signals are both electrical and chemical.
&tx60b=In Test 3, Heart B slowed without ever receiving an electrical signal. So communication in the nervous system can't be purely electrical.
&tx60d=Yes! Electricity triggers the release of chemical signals in the nervous system.
&tx60c=The nerve had to be stimulated electrically before the heart-slowing chemical was released.
Chemical signals must be triggered electrically.
&tx63a=Congratulations.
You've reconstructed the solution of one of the greatest scientific mysteries of the 20th century!
&tx63d=Otto Loewi, Graz Austria
&tx63b=In 1921, Otto Loewi demonstrated that electrical signals cause nerve cells to release chemicals called neurotransmitters in tests very similar to the ones you just performed. 
For this work, he won the Nobel Prize in 1936. 
&loaded=yes
