tot=5&topic1=Safety Procedures&text1=GENERAL GUIDELINES:
Always: 
- Read labels on chemicals twice before using them.
- Report all accidents to the lab supervisor immediately.
- Confine hair and loose clothing.
- Wear proper protective eyewear and clothing.
- Know where the emergency equipment (fire extinguisher, fire alarm, safety shower, eyewash) is located, and know the emergency response procedures.

Never:
- Engage in horseplay in the lab.
- Perform unauthorized work.
- Perform any hazardous work when alone in the lab.
- Leave the lab without washing hands and arms.
- Eat, smoke, drink, chew gum, apply cosmetics, or take medicine in the lab.
&topic2=Animal Handling Procedures&text2=Back in History, in the year 1986, the United States Government made several rules about how you can use animals in scientific research. These ancient documents set the standard for how animals are treated in research today.To find out more about how animals should be handled in the laboratory, go to the Animals in Research Section under LINKS at the end of the game.
1. Most of the animals used in research are rodents (rats and mice) that have been specifically bred for use in research. Animals are purchased from breeders and shipped to laboratories. A small number of animals for research come from pounds and humane societies. Fewer than one dog or cat is used in research for every 50 destroyed by pounds and humane societies to control the stray animal population. Pets are not used for medical research, and it is a myth that they are stolen and sold to laboratories.
2. Each animal must have the appropriate amount of food, water, and space to live ,as well as, housing with the proper bedding, temperature, humidity, lighting, and noise level conditions to ensure its health. Animals such as rats that do not like to live alone are housed together to lessen the animals' stress. They are monitored by a veterinarian to treat and prevent disease. While handling these animals, gloves may be worn, and in case of rats or mice, the animals may be held by the base of the tail for short periods of time when being moved from place to  place in the laboratory.
3. In their normal living conditions in the laboratory, animals are not in pain. If animals need to have painful procedures or surgery, they are treated by a technician or veterinarian with anesthetic to prevent pain. However, in some studies it is necessary for the animals to experience low levels of pain. The best example is the search for new pain-killing drugs.To find out more about how animals should be handled in the laboratory, go to the Animals in Research Section under LINKS at the end of the game.
&topic3=Medical Research Using Animals&text3=Animals in Research
Although humans may look different from rats, mice, dogs, or monkeys, they share many physical characteristics with these animals, allowing scientists to understand how the human body works. When scientists are developing a new drug or treatment for humans, they first do tests on animals. Based on the results of the animal experiments, predictions can be made as to how the drug or treatment will work in humans.
Many diseases and disorders have been treated or cured because of animal research. Examples include vaccines, anesthetics, analgesics, and innovations in surgical techniques.
&topic4=Hot Plate Test&text4=PURPOSE:   This test measures how long an animal can tolerate pain from a mild heat source.
PROCEDURE: A rat is given either a salt solution (saline) or a low, medium, or high dose of a substance dissolved in saline. The rat is then placed on a warm surface (52 degrees Celsius or 125.6 degrees Fahrenheit).  52 degrees Celsius is about as warm as the sidewalk is on a hot summer's day. The rat will lick its hindpaw when it first feels warm and uncomfortable. The longer the rat can keep its paw on the warm surface, the more effective the pain reliever (drug). The test substance is causing some pain relief or analgesia if the rat can keep its paw on the warm surface longer than 18 seconds. No rat should be left on the hot plate longer than 30 seconds so as to avoid harming the rat.
&topic5=Drug Doses&text5=When a drug is being tested in an experiment, scientists often use at least three different measured amounts or doses of drug. They do this in order to find out at which doses the drug works and doesn't work. If an animal is given a large amount (high dose) of a drug and it works, this doesn't mean that the drug will not work just as well if less of it (lower dose) is used. That's why it's a good idea to always test animals using several doses to find the optimum dosage.&done=1&end=end
